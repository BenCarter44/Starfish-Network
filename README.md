# Starfish-Network

A highly tolerant distributed network!

Creating a "virtualized computer" that can run on hundreds of nodes, with the nodes constantly going in and out. This virtualized computer has highly tolerant storage, can execute processes, and also hosts a shared database. This also will be completely decentralized, as opposed to a common technique of having a "master" server. All nodes are "treated the same"

Imagine a table with one hundred table legs. Now, imagine those table legs randomly appearing and disappearing. Will the table stay standing? This network seeks to make this possible, make a sturdy execution/storage environment highly tolerant of individual nodes coming and leaving.
